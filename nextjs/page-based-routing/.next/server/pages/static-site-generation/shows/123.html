Self-centered Shannon - who actually gives herself a pedicure amid the chaos - and her estranged controlling brother, Boone , constantly bicker and must learn to get along if they are to survive. And young Claire is eight months pregnant and ill-prepared for the hardships of motherhood - especially on a deserted island.</p><img alt="Lost" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F1389.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F1389.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F1389.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":123,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/123/lost","name":"Lost","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Adventure","Supernatural"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"averageRuntime":60,"premiered":"2004-09-22","ended":"2010-05-23","officialSite":"http://abc.go.com/shows/lost","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Tuesday"]},"rating":{"average":8.2},"weight":96,"network":{"id":3,"name":"ABC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":"https://abc.com/"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":4284,"thetvdb":73739,"imdb":"tt0411008"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/0/1389.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/0/1389.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003eOut of the blackness, the first thing Jack senses is pain.
