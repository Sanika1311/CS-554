Detective Steve McGarrett, a decorated Naval officer-turned-cop, returned to Oahu to investigate his father's murder and stayed after Hawaii's former governor persuaded him to head up the new team: his rules, no red tape and full blanket authority to hunt down the biggest \"game\" in town. Joining McGarrett is Detective Danny \"Danno\" Williams, a relocated ex-New Jersey cop - a working man in paradise who prefers skyscrapers to the coastline - but who's committed to keeping the Islands safe for his young daughter; Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-Honolulu police detective and former protégé of McGarrett's father who was wrongly accused of corruption; Dr. Max Bergman, the quirky coroner; Chin's cousin, Kono Kalakaua, a beautiful and fearless native; and Captain Lou Grover, who formerly headed Hawaii's SWAT unit. Joining them is Jerry Ortega, a former classmate of Chin's and the Island's local conspiracy theorist. The state's brash FIVE-0 unit, who may spar and jest among themselves, remain determined to eliminate the seedy elements from the 50th state.</p>","updated":1699544734,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/24"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1809248"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
