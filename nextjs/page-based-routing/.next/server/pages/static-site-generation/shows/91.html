Wild child Rebecca Wright knows how to have a good time, but she also happens to be one of L.A.&#x27;s toughest and most respected criminal court judges. She has a reputation for unorthodox behavior in the courtroom, including creative rulings and saying exactly what&#x27;s on her mind. Her private life, on the other hand, is anything but innocent. She parties too much and rocks out on the drums in a band with her best friend, Jenny. While there&#x27;s no shortage of male admirers who would love to spend time with her, she&#x27;s not ready to settle down... except when an 8-year-old boy - whose parents were put in jail by Rebecca - needs her help. He may, in fact, be the one thing that starts to tame this Bad Judge.</p><img alt="Bad Judge" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F678.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F678.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F678.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":91,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/91/bad-judge","name":"Bad Judge","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Comedy","Family"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"averageRuntime":30,"premiered":"2014-10-02","ended":"2015-01-22","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Thursday"]},"rating":{"average":7.4},"weight":78,"network":{"id":1,"name":"NBC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":"https://www.nbc.com/"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":35037,"thetvdb":281595,"imdb":"tt2769470"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/0/678.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/0/678.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003eNo excuses, no apologies, no compromises.
