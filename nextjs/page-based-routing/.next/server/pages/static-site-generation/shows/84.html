Lois is Peter&#x27;s wife, a stay-at-home mom with no patience for her family&#x27;s antics. Then there are their kids: 18-year-old Meg is an outcast at school and the Griffin family punching bag; 13-year-old Chris is a socially awkward teen who doesn&#x27;t have a clue about the opposite sex; and one-year-old Stewie is a diabolically clever baby whose burgeoning sexuality is very much a work in progress. Rounding out the Griffin household is Brian the family dog and a ladies&#x27; man who is one step away from AA.</p><img alt="Family Guy" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F488%2F1222068.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F488%2F1222068.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F488%2F1222068.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":84,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/84/family-guy","name":"Family Guy","type":"Animation","language":"English","genres":["Comedy","Family"],"status":"Running","runtime":30,"averageRuntime":30,"premiered":"1999-01-31","ended":null,"officialSite":"https://www.fox.com/family-guy/","schedule":{"time":"21:30","days":["Wednesday"]},"rating":{"average":7.5},"weight":100,"network":{"id":4,"name":"FOX","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":"https://www.fox.com/"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":3506,"thetvdb":75978,"imdb":"tt0182576"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/488/1222068.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/488/1222068.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFamily Guy\u003c/b\u003e follows Peter Griffin the endearingly ignorant dad, and his hilariously offbeat family of middle-class New Englanders in Quahog, RI.
