Between cleaning up after her boys and cleaning up the streets, she'd be the first to admit she has her \"hot mess\" moments in this hilariously authentic look at what it really means to be a working mom today. Somehow, she makes it all work with the help of her sexy and understanding partner, and things becomes even more complicated when her husband becomes her boss at the precinct. For Laura, every day is a high-wire balancing act.</p>","updated":1619728370,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/78"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/609073"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
