Simon Roberts is the head of a powerful agency, with the biggest clients and brands in the world, but even more important to him is that his daughter Sydney is by his side. As his partner, Sydney is Simon&#x27;s exact opposite - focused, organized and eager to make a name for herself, but also too busy parenting her father, which she&#x27;d resent if he wasn&#x27;t so brilliant at what he does. Joining them in the firm are the dashing and talented Zach art director Andrew, who&#x27;s as hard-working as he is neurotic; and the beautiful and deceptively smart assistant Lauren. With his team and his daughter behind him, Simon continues to set the advertising world on fire, and it looks like they are definitely buying what these crazy ones are selling.</p><img alt="The Crazy Ones" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F3713.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F3713.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F3713.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":226,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/226/the-crazy-ones","name":"The Crazy Ones","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Comedy"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"averageRuntime":30,"premiered":"2013-09-26","ended":"2014-04-17","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"21:30","days":["Thursday"]},"rating":{"average":7.2},"weight":85,"network":{"id":2,"name":"CBS","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":"https://www.cbs.com/"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":34467,"thetvdb":269643,"imdb":"tt2710104"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/1/3713.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/1/3713.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Crazy Ones\u003c/b\u003e is a comedy about a larger-than-life advertising genius whose unorthodox methods and unpredictable behavior would get him fired... if he weren't the boss.
