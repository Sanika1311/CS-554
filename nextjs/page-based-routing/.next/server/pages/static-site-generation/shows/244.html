With most of their men gone, and those who remain battling for control, the women struggle to survive, to find their independence, and to build a life in which to thrive and raise families. As the stories of Janestown&#x27;s citizens unfold we see the clash between a power-hungry father and son and the deep prejudices among races, but also the start of something akin to community in this Wild West. Western stories take civilization as a goal; they begin in blood, and end in the morality of Main Street.</p><img alt="Strange Empire" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F4585.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F4585.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F4585.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":244,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/244/strange-empire","name":"Strange Empire","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Western"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"averageRuntime":60,"premiered":"2014-10-06","ended":"2015-02-02","officialSite":"http://www.cbc.ca/strangeempire/","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Monday"]},"rating":{"average":7.2},"weight":48,"network":{"id":36,"name":"CBC","country":{"name":"Canada","code":"CA","timezone":"America/Halifax"},"officialSite":"https://www.cbc.ca/"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":43191,"thetvdb":282216,"imdb":"tt3920814"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/1/4585.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/1/4585.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eStrange Empire\u003c/b\u003e is a Western whose heroes are women.
