In this fictional drama, a former IBM executive, Joe MacMillan plans to reverse engineer the flagship product of his former employer and forces his current company, Cardiff Electric, into the personal computer race. MacMillan enlists the help of Gordon Clark, a great engineer whose unrealized dreams of creating a revolutionary product have created tension in his marriage to Donna, and Cameron Howe, a volatile prodigy who puts her future in jeopardy to join MacMillan&#x27;s rogue PC project. Halt and Catch Fire thrives on the spirit of innovation and explores what it&#x27;s like to stand at the forefront of something world-changing and work towards it, no matter the risk.</p><img alt="Halt and Catch Fire" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F2798.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F2798.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F2798.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":191,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/191/halt-and-catch-fire","name":"Halt and Catch Fire","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"averageRuntime":60,"premiered":"2014-06-01","ended":"2017-10-14","officialSite":"http://www.amc.com/shows/halt-and-catch-fire","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Saturday"]},"rating":{"average":8.3},"weight":90,"network":{"id":20,"name":"AMC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":null},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":33630,"thetvdb":271910,"imdb":"tt2543312"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/1/2798.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/1/2798.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHalt and Catch Fire\u003c/b\u003e is set roughly one year after IBM all but corners the market with the release of its first major product – the IBM PC.
