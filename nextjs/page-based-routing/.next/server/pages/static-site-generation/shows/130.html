His casual Malibu lifestyle is interrupted when his tightly wound brother Alan, who&#x27;s facing a divorce, and his son Jake, come to live with him. Together, these two and a half men confront the challenges of growing up; finally. Complicating matters are the brothers&#x27; self-obsessed, controlling mother, Evelyn, Alan&#x27;s estranged wife, Judith and Charlie&#x27;s crazy neighbor Rose, who wants to be a part of his life and is willing to do anything to be around. After the death of his brother, Alan Harper meets and befriends a lonely young man named Walden Schmidt who turns out to be a billionaire. Unable to afford his brother&#x27;s home, Alan sells Walden the house, and as a way of showing his gratitude, Walden allows Alan and his son Jake to move in with him.</p><img alt="Two and a Half Men" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F118%2F296854.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F118%2F296854.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F118%2F296854.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":130,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/130/two-and-a-half-men","name":"Two and a Half Men","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Comedy"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"averageRuntime":30,"premiered":"2003-09-22","ended":"2015-02-19","officialSite":"http://www.cbs.com/shows/two_and_a_half_men/","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Thursday"]},"rating":{"average":6.5},"weight":95,"network":{"id":2,"name":"CBS","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":"https://www.cbs.com/"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":6454,"thetvdb":72227,"imdb":"tt0369179"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/118/296854.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/118/296854.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003eCharlie is a well-to-do bachelor with a house at the beach, a Jaguar in the front, and an easy way with women.
