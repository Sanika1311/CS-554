Upon their arrival, they discover that the entire community is populated by residents from another planet. Amongst their myriad quirks, these aliens identify themselves by the names of sports celebrities, patrol the community in golf carts, dress alike, receive nourishment through their eyes and mind by reading books rather than eating, and cry green goo from their ears. The aliens have assumed human form, but they can revert to their natural appearance by clapping their hands above their heads. They have been stuck on Earth for 10 years, still awaiting instructions to return home.</p>","updated":1580639791,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/229"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/14593"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
