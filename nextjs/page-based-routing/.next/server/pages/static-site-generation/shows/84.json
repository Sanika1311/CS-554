Lois is Peter's wife, a stay-at-home mom with no patience for her family's antics. Then there are their kids: 18-year-old Meg is an outcast at school and the Griffin family punching bag; 13-year-old Chris is a socially awkward teen who doesn't have a clue about the opposite sex; and one-year-old Stewie is a diabolically clever baby whose burgeoning sexuality is very much a work in progress. Rounding out the Griffin household is Brian the family dog and a ladies' man who is one step away from AA.</p>","updated":1700950999,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/84"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/2679649"},"nextepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/2680425"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
