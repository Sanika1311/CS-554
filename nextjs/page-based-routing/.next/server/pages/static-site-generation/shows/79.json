For geeky and movie obsessed youngest child Adam, these were his wonder years, and he faced them armed with a video camera to capture all the crazy. <b>The Goldbergs</b> are a loving family like any other -- just with a lot more yelling. Mom Beverly is a classic \"smother,\" an overbearing, overprotective matriarch who loves her delicious kids, but still rules this brood with 100% authority and zero sense of boundaries. Dad Murray is gruff and sometimes oblivious, parenting with half his attention span but all his heart. Sister Erica is popular and terrifying, doing her best to cover up that she's the smartest of the clan. Barry is a passionate dreamer, who maybe dreams a little too big and who always gets the short end of the stick. Adam is the youngest, a camera-wielding future director who's navigating first love, and growing up with his family. Rounding out the family is beloved grandfather Al \"Pops\" Solomon, the wild man of the clan, a shameless Don Juan who's learning as much from his family as he teaches them.</p>","updated":1688569453,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/79"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/2510835"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
