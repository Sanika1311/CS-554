In Seasons Two and Three, as the Barksdale investigation escalated, new storylines involving pressures on the working class and the city&#x27;s political leadership were introduced. Season Four focused on the stories of several young boys in the public school system, struggling with problems at home and the lure of the corner - set against the rise of a new drug empire in West Baltimore and a new Mayor in City Hall. The fifth and final season of The Wire centers on the media&#x27;s role in addressing - or failing to address - the fundamental political, economic and social realities depicted over the course of the series, while also resolving storylines of the numerous characters woven throughout the narrative arc of the show.</p><img alt="The Wire" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F2527.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F2527.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F1%2F2527.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":179,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/179/the-wire","name":"The Wire","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Crime"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"averageRuntime":60,"premiered":"2002-06-02","ended":"2008-03-09","officialSite":"http://www.hbo.com/the-wire","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Sunday"]},"rating":{"average":8.9},"weight":97,"network":{"id":8,"name":"HBO","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":"https://www.hbo.com/"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":6296,"thetvdb":79126,"imdb":"tt0306414"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/1/2527.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/1/2527.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe first season of \u003cb\u003eThe Wire\u003c/b\u003e (2002) concentrated on the often-futile efforts of police to infiltrate a West Baltimore drug ring headed by Avon Barksdale and his lieutenant, Stringer Bell.
