Dolvett Quince and Jen Widerstrom return to train eight contestant teams of two, all with compelling stories. Seven teams (spouses, parent/adult child, siblings, relatives, best friends) will know each other, but one team will be two strangers - former &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; contestant and the original &quot;Survivor&quot; winner, Richard Hatch, and &#x27;The Voice&#x27; season two semi-finalist Erin Willett. Having both been in the NBC family previously, the two share the same goal as the other 14 contestants - to change their lives and get healthy. The renovated &quot;Biggest Loser&quot; gym, featuring a new interior and exterior branded with the new logo, has modernized equipment to help contestants better achieve their fitness goals, including eight high-tech monitors on the walls of each side of the gym that will track contestants&#x27; calorie burns as well as heart rates. Half of the gym will be dedicated to Team Dolvett and the other half dedicated to Team Jen. The weigh-in will be very different this season with a new look and double scales, so contestants on opposing teams can weigh-in side by side, making the weigh-in even more compelling to watch. The contestant house is also getting a whole new look for season 17.</p><img alt="The Biggest Loser" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F730.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F730.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F730.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":97,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/97/the-biggest-loser","name":"The Biggest Loser","type":"Reality","language":"English","genres":[],"status":"Running","runtime":60,"averageRuntime":62,"premiered":"2004-10-19","ended":null,"officialSite":"https://www.usanetwork.com/the-biggest-loser","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Tuesday"]},"rating":{"average":6},"weight":77,"network":{"id":30,"name":"USA Network","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":"https://www.usanetwork.com"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":5618,"thetvdb":75166,"imdb":"tt0429318"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/0/730.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/0/730.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003eNBC's \u003cb\u003eThe Biggest Loser\u003c/b\u003e, a show known for its incredible weight loss makeovers, will reveal an exciting makeover of its own when the popular series returns on Monday, January 4 (9-11 p.m. ET) with new host Bob Harper, a new \"Temptation\" theme, an updated state-of-the-art gym, a new logo, fun format changes and a return to the popular team vs. team competition.
