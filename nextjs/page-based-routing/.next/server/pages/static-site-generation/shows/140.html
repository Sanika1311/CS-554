Friendship may bind them, but each is at a markedly different point in his journey: Patrick is the 29-year-old video game designer getting back into the dating world in the wake of his ex&#x27;s engagement; aspiring artist Agustín, 31, is questioning the idea of monogamy amid a move to domesticate with his boyfriend; and the group&#x27;s oldest member - longtime waiter Dom, 39 - is facing middle age with romantic and professional dreams still unfulfilled.The trio&#x27;s stories intertwine and unspool dramatically as they search for happiness and intimacy in an age of unparalleled choices - and rights - for gay men. Also important to the ‘Looking&#x27; mix is the progressive, unpredictable, sexually open culture of the Bay Area, with real San Francisco locations serving as a backdrop for the group&#x27;s lives. Rounding out the ‘Looking&#x27; world are a bevy of dynamic gay men including Kevin, Lynn, and Richie, as well as a wide-range of supporting characters like Dom&#x27;s roommate Doris, Agustín&#x27;s boyfriend Frank, and Patrick&#x27;s co-worker Owen.</p><img alt="Looking" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F1961.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F1961.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F1961.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":140,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/140/looking","name":"Looking","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Comedy","Romance"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"averageRuntime":32,"premiered":"2014-01-19","ended":"2015-03-22","officialSite":"http://www.hbo.com/looking","schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Sunday"]},"rating":{"average":7.3},"weight":89,"network":{"id":8,"name":"HBO","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":"https://www.hbo.com/"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":37412,"thetvdb":274337,"imdb":"tt2581458"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/0/1961.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/0/1961.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLooking\u003c/b\u003e offers up the unfiltered experiences of three close friends living - and loving - in modern-day San Francisco.
