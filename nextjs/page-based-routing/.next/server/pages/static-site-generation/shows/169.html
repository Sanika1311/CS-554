White is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given a prognosis of two years left to live. With a new sense of fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and a desire to secure his family&#x27;s financial security, White chooses to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascends to power in this world. The series explores how a fatal diagnosis such as White&#x27;s releases a typical man from the daily concerns and constraints of normal society and follows his transformation from mild family man to a kingpin of the drug trade.</p><img alt="Breaking Bad" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F2400.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F2400.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F2400.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":169,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/169/breaking-bad","name":"Breaking Bad","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Crime","Thriller"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"averageRuntime":60,"premiered":"2008-01-20","ended":"2019-10-11","officialSite":"http://www.amc.com/shows/breaking-bad","schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Sunday"]},"rating":{"average":9.3},"weight":99,"network":{"id":20,"name":"AMC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":null},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":18164,"thetvdb":81189,"imdb":"tt0903747"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/0/2400.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/0/2400.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBreaking Bad\u003c/b\u003e follows protagonist Walter White, a chemistry teacher who lives in New Mexico with his wife and teenage son who has cerebral palsy.
