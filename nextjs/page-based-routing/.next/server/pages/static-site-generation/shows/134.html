As a total eclipse casts a shadow across the globe, viewers follow a genetics professor in India whose father&#x27;s disappearance leads him to uncover a secret theory—there are people with super powers living among us. A young dreamer tries to convince his politician brother that he can fly. A high school cheerleader learns that she is totally indestructible. A Las Vegas stripper, struggling to make ends meet to support her young son, uncovers that her mirror image has a secret. A prison inmate mysteriously finds himself waking up outside of his cell. A gifted artist, whose drug addiction is destroying his life and the relationship with his girlfriend, can paint the future. A down-on-his-luck beat cop can hear people&#x27;s thoughts, including the secrets of a captured terrorist. In Japan, a young man develops a way to stop time through sheer will power. Their ultimate destiny is nothing less than saving the world.</p><img alt="Heroes" loading="lazy" width="209" height="294" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" srcSet="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F1904.jpg&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F1904.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.tvmaze.com%2Fuploads%2Fimages%2Fmedium_portrait%2F0%2F1904.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"id":134,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/134/heroes","name":"Heroes","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Action","Science-Fiction"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"averageRuntime":60,"premiered":"2006-09-25","ended":"2010-02-08","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Monday"]},"rating":{"average":7.7},"weight":97,"network":{"id":1,"name":"NBC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":"https://www.nbc.com/"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":8172,"thetvdb":79501,"imdb":"tt0813715"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/0/1904.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/0/1904.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis epic chronicles the lives of ordinary people who discover they possess extraordinary abilities.
