Wild child Rebecca Wright knows how to have a good time, but she also happens to be one of L.A.'s toughest and most respected criminal court judges. She has a reputation for unorthodox behavior in the courtroom, including creative rulings and saying exactly what's on her mind. Her private life, on the other hand, is anything but innocent. She parties too much and rocks out on the drums in a band with her best friend, Jenny. While there's no shortage of male admirers who would love to spend time with her, she's not ready to settle down... except when an 8-year-old boy - whose parents were put in jail by Rebecca - needs her help. He may, in fact, be the one thing that starts to tame this <b>Bad Judge</b>.</p>","updated":1579722192,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/91"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/109577"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
